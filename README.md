Machine learning playground
===========================
This is where I will document my journey into statistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning.
I will share usefull resources and code examples that I hope will help others along the way.

[The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that can learn](http://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_terrifying_implications_of_computers_that_can_learn)

## What kind of problems can you solve with machine learning?
TODO

I intend to use frameworks such as:
https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs
https://github.com/harthur/brain
https://github.com/encog/encog-javascript
OpenCV

* Check out the [code examples](/Code examples/README.md)
The code examples will for the most part be in javascript/typescript, C#, R, Python and C++.

* Want to play around? Check out some of the [datasets](/Datasets/README.md)
* Read more about resources for getting into machine learning [here](/Usefull resources/README.md
